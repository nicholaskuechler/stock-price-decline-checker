Stock Price Decline Checker
===========================

Checks a list of stocks to see if the price has declined a certain percentage
from its maximum price over a specified number of days.

The goal is to identify primarily index ETFs that have declined substantially
in price from their maximum values over the past few weeks or months, which
could potentially signal a buying opportunity.

Example output:

<pre>
Symbols: ['QQQ', 'SPY', 'DIA']

Verbose: True

Checking for a 5.0% decline over the past 50 days

The stock price decline checker will display an alert if the stock has dropped
in price greater than the percentage specified:

    python stock-price-decline-checker.py -s GOOG,FB -d 50 -p 7.5

Note how FB has now triggered an alert since it has fallen over 7.5%:
